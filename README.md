# Paint the Toon
Paint the Toon is an app that allows you to view all of Glasgow's murals on a scrollable, scaleable map. Users can click on pins that mark each mural for more information and images. Users can also write reviews and save their favourites.

## Basic Brief: Educational App

We were given a brief to create an interactive browser application that displays information in a fun and interesting way. The task was to make an a Minimum Viable Product or prototype that may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app.

### MVP

A user should be able to:

- view some educational content on a particular topic
- be able to interact with the page to move through different sections of content

### Example Extensions

- Use an API to bring in content or a database to store information.
- Use charts, canvas or maps to display your information to the page.

## API, Libraries, Resources

We used the following technology to build Paint the Toon

- Vue to provide the front end
- MongoDB to create the API and save favourites and reviews
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), an open-source library for rendering maps and map functionality.

## JavaScript Group Project Guidelines

### Aims

- To gain experience working in a team with other developers - to understand some of the challenges this creates and ways to overcome them
- To have the opportunity to use Agile working methods
- To become more confident using Git/GitHub for a multi person project
- To consolidate learning from the JavaScript module
- To investigate some JavaScript libraries you haven't used before (learning how to read docs is an invaluable skill)

### Expectations

- All members of the group contributing to the planning, development and presentation of the project
- Members supporting each other to make sure everyone can get the most they can from the week
- TDD - unit testing of models where appropriate
- Some application of Agile concepts e.g. a morning standup, sprints, a kanban board (Trello)
- Regular Git commits and use of branches with frequent merges. We are looking to see at least 100 commits.
